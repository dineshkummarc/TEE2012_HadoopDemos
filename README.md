===================

This is a set of demos used at TechEd Europe 2012

Data Set assumptions
===================

The bulk of these demos operate on a set of flight delay information, originally obtained from the Azure DataMarket (available here: https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/e29b7fb9-3d2e-4f35-8088-c97dbd75cd1f)

We expect the following comma separated schema for these demo jobs:
